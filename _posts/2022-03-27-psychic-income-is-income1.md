# Salvation or Snake-Oil?

If you've spent any amount of time researching, discussing or trading crypto you are likely to have encountered both:

- Maximalists:
  - The world order is due for upheavel
  - The Nation State and privately-owned oligopolies can cancel anyone
  - Decentralization + Trustlessness is panacea

- Cryptodeniers:
  - Crypto = Tulips
  - It's a giant ponzi scheme

IMO we're at a point in the curve when both arguments hold water and only time will tell which of these ideas will survive the extinction phase that follows this cambrian explosion.

# Myths & Egregores

As Yuval Noah Harari discusses in [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.in/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0099590085), we Homo Sapiens owe our success, in part, to being able to engage in collective delusions that have enabled collaboration at scale.
