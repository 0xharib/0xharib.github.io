excerpt: How far are we from having personal assistants that match the expectations created by the likes of Jarvis from Iron Man or Samantha from Her (2013)

## The Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA)

![Virtual Assistants](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/210436/screenshots/5802575/media/0f5ca1a937688a95b4505775e8e814dc.png?compress=1&vertical=top)

The idea of IVAs is not new. IVA adoption has grown recently owing to:
1. Speech to text / text to speech / NLU tech improving to a point where conversation interactions with a "chatbot" become possible
2. Most OSs come with an embedded IVA across Siri, Google Assistant, Bixby, Alexa or Cortana

Apart from Google Assistant though, the naming of these IVAs tempts users to anthropomorphize and ascribe agency to them which is clearly misguided.   

## Agency
I will stop here to define Agency as the ability to:

1. Think independently
2. Act on that thinking (Free Will)

IVAs as they stand today simply do not have such capabilities.

Most importantly neither does Generative AI.

## Look at what ChatGPT said when I asked...

![Chinese Room]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023/chineseroom.png)

[The Chinese Room](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/minds-brains-and-programs/DC644B47A4299C637C89772FACC2706A) argument put forward by John Searle in 1980 best explains:  

- You don't know a word of Chinese(sic).
- You're locked up in a room with a mail slot and receive letters exclusively written in kanji.
- There is also a rule book present inside the room which you can look up and has rules for how to respond to each character or series of characters that you see with another equivalent series of kanji characters
- You blindly follow these rules to produce a series of responses which are meaningful to those outside the room

Does this mean that you understand Chinese?  
Clearly NOT.    

Well Generative AI does exactly this. Sure the rule book is "emergent" from weights in a neural network rather than explicit programming but that doesn't dint the argument in any way.   

## Analyzing Samantha

Samantha in Her (2013) displays a wide range of capabilities. Let's try to break that down into categories.

### Objective & Achievable today
- Contacts Management
- Personal Organizer
- Proof reading content for grammar/spelling
- Calendar reminders
- Hotel reservations
- Read and Reply to emails
- Background checks on blind dates

### Subjective & Achievable today
- Email classification as important/unimportant
- Edit / summarize content for style
- Cherry pick written content as "the best"
- Picking a present for someone

### Achievable with Generative AI
- High quality romantic conversations
- Companionship / Pseudo therapist

### Probably won't happen
- Interact with external agents to get content published
- "OSes going away"
