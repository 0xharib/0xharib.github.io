As a first step to exposing myself to books outside my comfort zone I’ve built this basic tool - [https://goo.gl/6m4h4r](https://goo.gl/6m4h4r)

This google sheet contains the nearly 10,000 audiobooks available at National Library of Singapore and randomly recommends 5 of them with helpful Overdrive download links.

The plan is to open this sheet whenever I’m on the lookout for a new book and force myself to download at least one of the 5, preferably something outside my comfort zone.

Let’s see how it goes!
