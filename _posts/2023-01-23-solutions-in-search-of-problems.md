excerpt: Cabbages and cauliflowers were the result of enterprising individuals experimenting with a wild ancestor. Generative AI today, similarly has accessible, low cost primitives, waiting to be experimented with, not unlike brassica oleracea growing on the limestone cliffs of the Mediterranean all those years ago.
This time, hopefully, we won't have to wait for 2000 years to get cauliflowers.

# Brassica Oleracea

Brassica Oleracea could be called a weed. It grows in the wild, primarily in the Mediterranean on exposed limestone cliffs, largely unremarkable except for its tiny yellow flowers which bloom over the summer.
Over 3 centuries ago, humankind first domesticated this plant, and over time, through the magic of artificial selection, we now have a variety of edible "vegetables" - cabbages, cauliflower, kale, broccoli and much more.
This transformation took over 2000 years starting with the earliest cabbages in 1000 BC to the modern day kohlrabi around 1400 AD.
