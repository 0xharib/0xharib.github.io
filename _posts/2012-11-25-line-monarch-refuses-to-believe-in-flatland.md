[Suhas Mathur](http://suhasmathur.com) introduced me to [Flatland](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/).

Makes a strong case for why all atheists should choose to be [agnostic atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_atheism) instead.

_You ask me to believe there is another Line besides that which my senses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am daily conscious. I, in return, ask you to describe in words or indicate by motion that other Line of which you speak. Instead of moving, you merely exercise some magic art of vanishing and returning to sight; and instead of any lucid description of your new World, you simply tell me the numbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts known to any child in my capital. Can anything be more irrational or audacious? Acknowledge your folly or depart from my dominions._
