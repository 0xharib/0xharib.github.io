excerpt: It seems like ChatGPT can answer all your tax questions. So why then do you need a separate TaxGPT product?

One common & recurrent idea amongst ChatGPT evangelists is that  

*But you can just ask ChatGPT. Why do you need a separate tool on top of it?*  

For instance can't I just do this?

The answer is NO!

To explain why let me use an illustration:   
Here is me asking ChatGPT about a series of books written by the late Richmal Crompton called "Just William"   

### Starters

Looks impressive.   
You can check out this site which is a society of Crompton's fans presided by her next of kin: (http://www.justwilliam.co.uk/page-bibliography1st.htm) to see the ACTUAL list of books. There are many many mistakes and inconsistencies in the list that ChatGPT has produced.   

### Let's get specific

![Asking ChatGPT about HUF]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023/tax4.png) 

I specifically chose William the Outlaw because the book is not yet out of copyright. It's contents page is available on Google Books though.

With complete confidence GPT has hallucinated the contents page for this book which has zero basis in fact.  

And finally the icing on the cake. A completely fictional summary of a chapter that doesn't exist, peppered with just enough red herrings  to imply reality. For instance, Hubert Lane is a real character from the series and is indeed William's nemesis.

### TL;DR
ChatGPT is capable of extremely convincing, complex hallucinations and is unreliable when it comes to answering factual questions without being guided to focus on specific context.  

And no. ChatGPT <> TaxGPT.
