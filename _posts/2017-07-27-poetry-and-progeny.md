In terms of firsts, the earliest memory I have of a book that I self-read is this combo of ["Whiskers for a Cat and Bilderoo is coming"](https://www.amazon.com/Enid-Blytons-Whiskers-Mini-World/dp/0723576351). When I extend the same question to poetry there is nothing that comes to mind.

Until today.

Thanks to kiddo I rediscovered [Eleanor Farjeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Farjeon)&nbsp;and [Cats](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/cats-sleep-anywhere/)&nbsp;which we read and re-read until one of us had had enough. The poem evokes strong, and very likely false, childhood memories of the stale wooden scent of classroom 2B, my grandpa's deep voice and my desire to own a cat as a child.

Still trundling through this reverie I stumbled upon this meta gem:

_I'll tell you, shall I, something I remember?_  
_Something that still means a great deal to me._  
_It was long ago._

_A dusty road in summer I remember,_  
_A mountain, and an old house, and a tree_  
_That stood, you know,_

_Behind the house. An old woman I remember_  
_In a red shawl with a grey cat on her knee_  
_Humming under a tree._

_She seemed the oldest thing I can remember._  
_But then perhaps I was not more than three._  
_It was long ago._

_I dragged on the dusty road, and I remember_  
_How the old woman looked over the fence at me_  
_And seemed to know_

_How it felt to be three, and called out, I remember_  
_'Do you like bilberries and cream for tea?'_  
_I went under the tree._

_And while she hummed, and the cat purred, I remember_  
_How she filled a saucer with berries and cream for me_  
_So long ago._

_Such berries and such cream as I remember_  
_I never had seen before, and never see_  
_Today, you know._

_And that is almost all I can remember,_  
_The house, the mountain, the gray cat on her knee,_  
_Her red shawl, and the tree,_

_And the taste of the berries, the feel of the sun I remember,_  
_And the smell of everything that used to be_  
_So long ago,_

_Till the heat on the road outside again I remember_  
_And how the long dusty road seemed to have for me_  
_No end, you know._

_That is the farthest thing I can remember._  
_It won't mean much to you. It does to me._  
_Then I grew up, you see.&nbsp;_

&nbsp;

Of course we had to finish with:

_Five minutes, five minutes more, please!_  
_Let me stay five minutes more!_  
_Can't I just finish the castle_  
_I'm building here on the floor?_  
_Can't I just finish the story_  
_I'm reading here in my book?_  
_Can't I just finish this bead-chain â€”_  
_It almost is finished, look!_  
_Can't I just finish this game, please?_  
_When a game's once begun_  
_It's a pity never to find out_  
_Whether you've lost or won._  
_Can't I just stay five minutes?_  
_Well, can't I just stay just four?_  
_Three minutes, then? two minutes?_  
_Can't I stay one minute more?&nbsp;_

As we reluctantly wound up for the evening I had to but wonder if kiddo would one day find a lost part of themselves while attempting to similarly educate a greener, and perhaps artificial, mind.
