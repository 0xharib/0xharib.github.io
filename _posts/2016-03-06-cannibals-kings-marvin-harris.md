A wonderful [book](http://www.amazon.com/Cannibals-Kings-Cultures-Marvin-Harris/dp/067972849X)! Gave me deep insights especially into the cultural origins of&nbsp;[androcentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androcentrism).

Closing words are lines to live by:

_ **In Life, as in any game where the outcome depends on both luck and skill, the rational response to bad odds is to try harder.** _
