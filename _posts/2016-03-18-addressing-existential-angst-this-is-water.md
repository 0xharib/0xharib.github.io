I find myself coming back again and again to&nbsp;this wonderful [David Foster Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace)&nbsp;speech (~20 mins) on how to deal with existential angst, that I found a few months ago. I recommend you&nbsp;[listen to it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI)&nbsp;while&nbsp;[reading it here](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf).

Summarizing or quoting here would be a disservice to the original so I am going to refrain from doing that. If you like what you hear and want to know more about DFW I recommend watching [The End of the Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBk1Mrb4RyM).
