It's admission season here in Delhi and kiddo is in the fray. The DOE does a pretty neat job of putting up registered applicants school wise [here](http://www.edudel.nic.in/mis/smc/other/frmChildrenAppliedforAdmissionDistWiseReport1718.aspx)&nbsp;which is great if you're querying by **school** but sucks if you're querying by **student name**. I wrote a little scraper + data reorganizer for my personal use last weekend.

I've tried wrapping it into a Google site here for anyone who is looking to get a summary of points across schools for their ward:

[https://sites.google.com/view/delhi-school-search/home](https://sites.google.com/view/delhi-school-search/home)

I am not the front end guru so pardon the poor quality of the site. Please feel free to share with anyone who is looking to get a points summary for their kid.

Also to follow when I get the time: some interesting data visualizations.
