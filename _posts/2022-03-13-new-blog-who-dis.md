Going forward this blog will be hosted on github.io

## Why?
- I've loved the elegance and simplicity of markdown
- I'm also a fan of git & github
- I've been looking to get more hands-on especially with themes
- I'm not a fan of wordpress.com

## Thanks are due to:
- [Akshay Ranganath](https://akshayranganath.github.io/Migrating-Wordpress-Blogs-to-Github-Pages/)
- [Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
- [kitian616](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) - this is what I finally went with

# To-dos
- Getting redirections & images right
- Fixing theme
- Adding other elements
